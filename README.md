# TASK DESCRIPTION

**Project: Basic Smart Light Control with ESP32 and Blynk**

Concept: This project demonstrates a fundamental smart lighting system where an LED (representing a light) connected to an ESP32 microcontroller can be turned ON and OFF remotely using the Blynk mobile application over a Wi-Fi connection.

**Hardware Components:**

- ESP32 Development Board
  
- LED (any color)
  
- 220-ohm Current Limiting Resistor
  
- Jumper Wires
  
- Breadboard

**Software:**

- Arduino IDE (with ESP32 board support installed)

- Blynk Library installed in Arduino IDE

- Blynk Mobile Application (available for Android and iOS)

**Wiring Diagram:**

- Connect the positive (longer) leg of the LED to one end of the 220-ohm resistor.

- Connect the other end of the resistor to one of the digital output pins on the ESP32 (e.g., GPIO 2).

- Connect the negative (shorter) leg of the LED to a GND (ground) pin on the ESP32.
